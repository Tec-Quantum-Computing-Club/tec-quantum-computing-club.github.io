### About the Lab

Welcome to the home page of the Photonics and Mathematical Optics Group of the Tecnológico de Monterrey (also known by Photonics and Quantum Systems), headed by [Prof. Julio C. Gutiérrez-Vega](./team/julio-cesar). Our Group is part of the Optics Center and the  Physics Department of the Tecnológico de Monterrey, México. Founded in 2003 by Prof. Julio C. Gutiérrez-Vega, the PMOG is formed by a group of professors, research students, and collaborators from other institutes, whose research interests range from fiber optics and propagation to lasers and resonators. The PMOG is one of the pioneer research groups in Mathematical Optics in Mexico. The main research areas of the PMOG are laser resonators, nondiffracting propagation of wavefields, Ince-Gaussian beams, attenuation characteristics of waveguides and resonators, classical and quantum billiards and numerical methods of special functions.

The main areas of research of the Photonics and Mathematical Optics Group (PMOG) cover the fields of Novel Beams and Propagation, including Bessel, Mathieu and parabolic nondiffracting beams, as well as Ince-Gaussian beams, numerical methods of special functions, propagation of optical solitons, complex source theory, and laser resonators. Although most of our work is directed to theoretical studies, we carry out experiments on CO2 Bessel-Gauss resonators, and generation of Nondiffracting beams by holographic methods.
