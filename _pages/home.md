### About the Lab

Welcome to the home page of the Photonics and Mathematical Optics Group of the Tecnológico de Monterrey (also known by Photonics and Quantum Systems), headed by Prof. Julio C. Gutiérrez-Vega. Our Group is part of the Optics Center and the  Physics Department of the Tecnológico de Monterrey, México.

The main areas of research of the Photonics and Mathematical Optics Group (PMOG) cover the fields of Novel Beams and Propagation, including Bessel, Mathieu and parabolic nondiffracting beams, as well as Ince-Gaussian beams, numerical methods of special functions, propagation of optical solitons, complex source theory, and laser resonators. Although most of our work is directed to theoretical studies, we carry out experiments on CO2 Bessel-Gauss resonators, and generation of Nondiffracting beams by holographic methods.
